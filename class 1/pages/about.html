	<p><b>The ocean is dark and mysterious</b> it’s ominous, yet majestic.
The ocean is a tight embrace before the abyss of freedom. It’s a gentle summer breeze caressing your face as the waves splash your ankles — harmless on the surface.<br>
It’s the beautiful array of animals and coral lining the ocean floor, reminding you of eternal beauty.
But it’s forever vast and unknown beings lurk in its depths — danger but never-ending magic beneath the surface.</p>
